   <h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>

      <h3>Okay, so what's actually in it?</h3>
      <p>That's an extremely good question. The issue with this is that it's so damn large I can't even remember everything inside off the top of my head. Here's a by-no-means exhaustive list:</p>

      <h3>Can you port this to Chromebooks or smartphones?</h3>
      <p>Due to compatibility issues with Flash, and the browser engine the collection runs on, the only platforms we can support are Windows/Mac/Linux. These problems may be solved in the distant future, but right now our hands are tied.</p>

      <h3>Help! I'm already far into Homestuck on the official website, but the application won't let me past the beginning!</h3>
      <p>When you start up the program for the first time, "new reader mode" is enabled and set by default - this is a toggle that will hide certain spoilery content until it's safe. This does also prevent you from skipping ahead - but you can manually set your progress through the story on the settings page.</p>
      <img src="images/new_reader.png" style="border: solid 2px;">
      <p>Enter your current page number and hit "Adjust" - this should catch everything up to where you currently are.</p>

      <h3>Why are there two different downloads?</h3>
      <p>
        <p>The collection is composed of two parts: the main app, and the Asset Pack. The main app handles the code and logic and processing, and the asset pack stores the data. For a couple of different reasons (namely, the Asset Pack is very large and also not GPL licensed) we distribute the Asset Pack and the collection separately.</p>
        <p>The good news is the collection can be updated with bugfixes and features without requiring a new Asset Pack! We use semantic versioning, so if you were on 1.0.0, an update to 1.0.X would be a bugfix, and an update to 1.X.X would mean bugfixes and new features. Only an update to X.X.X would require re-downloading a new asset pack/patch.</p>
      </p>

      <h3>I can't extract the Asset Pack, my [unusual environment] says it's corrupted!</h3>
      <p>
        <p>It's not corrupted, you're using a ZIP unarchiver in compatibility mode <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011203085830/http://www.pkware.com/support/appnote.txt">for the previous millennium</a>. Use a modern zip extractor like 7-zip, or at least one that isn't choosing to actively sabotage you.</p>
      </p>
